## About

The [Free & Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) version of the popular point of sales(POS) and stock management software created with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [VUEJS](https://vuejs.org), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) and powered by [EletronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/).

### Disclaimer

This version isn't intended for proffesional use cases, is an experiment to test the full potential of PHP. 

### Notes

For a proffesional scope there exists a commercial `+Plus` version made with [Go](https://go.dev/) being this faster, lightweight and with more features as you would expect from a complete [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning).
